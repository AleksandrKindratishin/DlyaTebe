The main idea of this project is to create concerts and organize various genre musical performances at creative charity events that unite and involve compassionate viewers in supporting hospitals and intensive care units where seriously ill children are being treated. Together with musicians and creative groups from different countries around the world, we support children's hospitals in Dnipro. Funds raised at charity concerts and events are directed towards the treatment of children and the needs of pediatric departments. Currently, we are eager to expand our circle of creative friends who are willing to collaborate with our foundation to save new lives! Therefore, we invite music groups, vocalists, musicians, and simply compassionate people to join our "Heartstrings" team! We will be very happy to welcome new open hearts!</p>
